    <h1>Lenard waited for a day until he hatched</h1>
    <p>Now that Lenard is a larva, he can move freely! Lenard sets out on his journey and stumbles oppon an injured Aphid. Even thought Lenard is hungry, his "humanity" is keeping him from eating it. The aphid looks juicy and tasty, but he couldn't just kill the little thing. Just then, the aphid looked into Lenard's eyes. Lenard could tell it needed help.</p>
    <h2>Should Lenard eat the Aphid or help it?</h2>
