  <h2>The grandfather paradox.</h2>
<p> The grandfather paradox is a paradox that states that if you were to go back in time and kill your grandfather your father would not be born. But if you were not alive then would you have been able to commit the action to begin with?</p>
<p> To first understand this, you first need to understand time. Think of time as a number line. You are in the middle of time while all past events are going to the left of the line while the future is to the right of you. But you are constanty moving throught time, it never stops.</p>
<p> There are some theories that state that there are multiple univeres and timelines than our. Basically the multiverse.</p>
<p> There is also Albert Einsteins Theory of relitivity that states that time and space are related.</p>
<p> Figuring out time travel is difficult enough to understand but time itself is much more difficult.</p>
<p> Time is not an object you can hold. It is not tangible. It is only something that you can belive tat exsists. </p>
<p> To understand time is to understand eternity.  If you could understand time then you could in turn understand God and his reason.</p>
 Time continues to march forward as we grow old and die. Time cannot be stopped. To stop time would mean that everyting would stand still. </p>
