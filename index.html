<p>There are many types of bananas. The most common are the ones you buy at the store. My favorite are the ones from russia that taste like starfruit, obviously. these banana's are very rare, and they cost about 1 million russian currency dollars, which is equivalent to about 1 cent. if you want to buy these bananas, then you would have to travel all the way to russia and sneak into the russian commie bases to steal them. and then sell them for many, many cents. </p>
<p>If you cannot afford to buy a ticket to russia, then break federal law, break past tsa in the airport, and sneak onto a plane heading to russia. if you are already here, than you have failed, because i am going to tell you something you needed to do before you arrived in russia. you need to steal your russian commie friends secret commie suit, and THEN sneak onto the plane and head to russia, sneak into the commie base and steal the bananas. then you sneak back onto a plane heading to the us, and then you have your starfruit tasting bananas from russia.</p>
