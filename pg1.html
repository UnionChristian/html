<h1>Why Hitler Was A Great Guy</h1>
Hitler was a wonderful person. He worked very hard to help find
the cures many sickneses. The people may not have agreed to be 
tested on but it needed to be done. Some of the sicknesses he
cured are in the list bellow. Many people hated him and 
then he went into a spiroling depresion. I will talk more 
about this on pg 3. Acording to peta he never hurt any animals
which means that everything he did was justified. He was also
christian acording to the totaly real quote bellow.
