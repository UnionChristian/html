    <h1>Lenard ate the Aphid</h1>
    <p>The aphid was filling. Lenard felt like he had tons of energy now. Lenard continued on his journy and he found a human house. The sun was staring to set and the house would be a great place for shelter, so he goes in. He finds a spider in the walls that is about 3x Lenard's size. Lenard is frozen solid out of fear as the spider slowly crawled toward him. The spider stopped, then started to wind up for a lunge. Lenard knew he had to fight, so he prepared for one. Then the spider lunged out at him and he dodged, that's when the fight began. Lenard won the battle.</p></td>
