        <h1>Lenard helped the aphid</h1>
        <p>Lenard Helped the aphid and healed him up. The aphid seemed to be scared of him, but it was thankfull that he was helping it. Lenard left it alone in a safe place and continued his journey. He found a house and decided to go in it for shelter because the sun was going down. When Lenard went inside there was a spider 3x his size! Lenard was frozen solid as the spider slowly crawled toward him. As the spider leaped toward him to attack, the aphid jumped out and defended Lenard! The two of them fought the spider together and won!</p>
        <h2>Lenard and the aphid lived happily ever after</h2>
